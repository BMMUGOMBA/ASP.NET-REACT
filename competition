Dear Team,
We’re excited to announce that SBG will be applying to participate in the AWS AI League—a unique program designed to accelerate AI skills and innovation through hands-on learning and friendly competition. 
What is AWS AI League?
The AWS AI League combines practical AI training with a gamified competition using AWS tools like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. It’s an opportunity to upskill, collaborate, and create real-world AI solutions. 
No coding skills/experience is required. 
Event Structure: 
•	Kick-off Workshop (2 hours): Led by AWS experts, introducing generative AI concepts and tools. 
•	Self-Paced Experimentation (< 10 hours): Teams work on industry-relevant challenges, fine-tuning models and crafting prompts using AWS AI services. 
•	Leaderboard & Feedback: Solutions are evaluated in real time based on accuracy and performance. 
•	Grand Finale (1 hour): A gameshow-style showcase where teams (5 best fine-tuned AI models) present their AI solutions addressing real business challenges. 
•	Prizes & Recognition: Compete for bragging rights and AWS-sponsored rewards! 
The League should be completed by 31 October 2025. Dates will be confirmed ASAP.
The winner will get an opportunity to compete at the finals during re:Invent 2025 with 20 global flagships, AWS will sponsor a 5-night trip to Las Vegas from 1 – 5 December 2025, including economy flights, $500 spending money, transfers from Las Vegas airport to hotel, and 5* hotel accommodation.

Hi Team,
Thank you for confirming your participation in the AWS AI League! It’s incredibly exciting to know that one of you will be heading to re:Invent in Las Vegas! And of course, we will make sure to deck you out in Standard Bank blue for the final challenge on the big stage.
I wanted to keep you updated on our progress. We are currently engaging with AWS to finalize all the necessary arrangements for the activities. Our plan is to have the kick off session on 7 October and have the final challenge three weeks later, on 28 October. Please pencil these dates into your calendar, and we will confirm them as soon as possible.
All future communication and invitations will come from the cloudenablementengine@standardbank.co.za mailbox, so please keep a close eye on your inbox.
We are thrilled to be one of the 20 companies selected to participate, and we trust that all 394 of you will stay committed. Unfortunately, there is a minimum number required, and dropping below that will disqualify us. However, there's still an opportunity to add more people, so if you know any colleagues who might be interested, please let them register here.
Looking forward to this exciting journey together!
Let’s embrace this opportunity to learn, innovate, and lead in AI!
